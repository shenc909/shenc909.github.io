Developing an autonomous drone platform for personal exploration.

## Introduction

The autonomous drone platform is a personal project for self-development and exploration. It is very roughly within the SAFMC (Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition) specifications for weight and size.

## Overview of Task

- Determine specifications and parts required for a drone near the upper limit for SAFMC
- Develop and design an airframe for the drone
- Enable autonomy via a ROS-enabled Single Board Computer (SBC) communicating with the flight controller

## Outcomes

### Initial Specifications

The base specifications chosen were based on the SAFMC rule limits. This resulted in a high level design goal of developing a drone capable of handling up to 4 kg of payload, with a thrust to weight ratio (TWR) of 3 for manouverability. Based on those design goals (and my budget), an X-configuration, 8 motor, coaxial design was chosen.

### Autonomy

The drone provides the capacity for autonomy via an onboard LattePanda Alpha board, which provides an Intel Core m3 processor as well as an integrated Arduino Leonardo equialent pinout. The flight controller, a Pixhawk 2 Cube running the PX4 stack, will interface with the SBC via MAVROS.
